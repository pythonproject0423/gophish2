<p> Phishing attacks are an ongoing thing and the companies who protect themselves against phishing attacks keep them at bay. Since, small businesses do not take
the appropriate steps to protect against phishing and they do not respond like they
should when cyber attacks happen. They lose completely in terms of finance and reputation and they do at times end up under legal issues. But why?</p>
<p>We see that business owners understand the risk and majority percentage responded that they’re concerned about cyber attacks. However, half of businesses owners mention finances as the reason for not taking a proactive stance against cyber attacks. They miss one key fact: Human error, not infrastructure, causes these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Businesses miss addressing the human element to protect against phishing, and invest in cyber insurance, installation of IDS intrusion detection, hire cybersecurity experts, but without addressing the human factor, their efforts fall short.</p>
<p>This is specially true when it comes to phishing scams, a type of social engineering attack that continues to grow.</p>
